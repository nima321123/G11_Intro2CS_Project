# RTOS Framework Project. G11 

This project is designed to follow the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) framework. It consists of three main tasks, each implemented as a class. An object of each task is declared and added to the scheduler.

## Project Overview

1. **Task 1: Clone Climate Info from OpenWeatherMap**
   - This task is responsible for fetching climate information from the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how to use an API to collect weather data and showcases the multitasking capabilities of the RTOS.

2. **Task 2: Disease Detection using AI Model**
   - Task 2 showcases the power of artificial intelligence by utilizing an AI model for disease detection. 

3. **Task 3: CNN Image Classification with PyTorch**
   - Task 3 focuses on computer vision and deep learning, using the PyTorch library to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying five different flower species based on images. This task demonstrates the application of deep learning in an RTOS environment.

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
  
   git clone https://github.com/nima321123/G11_Intro2CS_Project.git
  

2. Install the required packages

- **Task 1:**
- **Task 2:**
- **Task 3:**
  - **PyTorch**: PyTorch is a deep learning framework.
    - Install with: `pip install torch`
  - **Torchvision**: Torchvision is a library for computer vision tasks, providing datasets and data transformation utilities.
    - Install with: `pip install torchvision`
  - **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is used for data visualization.
    - Install with: `pip install matplotlib`
  - **NumPy**: NumPy is for numerical operations and data manipulation.
    - Install with: `pip install numpy`

Additionally, the code assumes that you have access to a dataset for image classification, which is loaded from a local directory. You need to specify the correct dataset path and structure in the code to match your project's requirements. If you intend to run this code on a GPU, you'll also need GPU support and the CUDA toolkit installed to take full advantage of PyTorch's GPU acceleration capabilities.

4. Run the main file
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
